# Obsidian Portal Custom Theme

This project contains custom CSS styling for Obsidian Portal campaigns. The styles will make the page layout wider, a little bit denser, and make the different components feel a little less free-floating.

### Features

- Denser layout, instead of free-floating elements.

- Right-hand sidebar that falls down below on mobile.

- Changes to page heading styles to better separate.

- Dark theme version. ðŸ‘»

## Restyling a theme

At the top of each `style-[name].css` file located under `themes`, there is a list of [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) that are used in that theme. You can adjust a theme to your heart's content by changing any of the values listed here.

```css
:root {
  --main-bg-color: #161617;
  --bg-color-light: #1f2022;
